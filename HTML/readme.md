# 📘 Coding Platforms Website (Frontend Practice)

This project is part of my **Learning Frontend** repository and focuses on building a **multi-page static website** using **pure HTML**. The project simulates an educational platform similar to *Coding Ninjas*, featuring course listings, user registration, login, contact information, and an admin dashboard.


## 📌 Project Overview

Project 1 is designed to practice **HTML fundamentals**, semantic structure, navigation between multiple pages, forms, tables, multimedia elements, and embedded content.

It does **not use CSS or JavaScript**, keeping the focus strictly on HTML concepts.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**



## 📄 Pages Included

* **Home Page (`index.html`)**

  * About section
  * Featured courses
  * Testimonials
  * Navigation bar

  * Course descriptions
  * Embedded video previews
  * Enrollment links

* **Register Page (`register.html`)**

  * User registration form
