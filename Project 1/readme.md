# 🍽️ Project 1 – Restaurant Website

This project is a **basic multi-page static website** created using **HTML** as part of my **frontend learning journey**. It represents a simple restaurant website with navigation, dish listings, customer reviews, and a contact form.

All images used in the project are stored **in the same folder as the HTML files**.
