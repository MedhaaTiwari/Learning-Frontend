# 🏏 Project 2 – National Cricket Team Website

This project is part of my **Learning Frontend** repository and focuses on building a visually rich static website using **HTML and CSS**. The theme of this project is the **Indian National Cricket Team**, highlighting coaches, star players, and rankings.



## 📌 Project Overview

The website demonstrates the use of:

* Fixed and sticky elements
* Image cards with text overlays
* Scrollable sections
* Tables for structured data
* Custom cursor interaction for fun UI effects

It is designed as a single-page static site with emphasis on layout, positioning, and styling.
